# Trial
This repo is has some scribbles for common tasks I need. (Adventurous hitchhikers, use discretion)
- `GitTutorial.md` some commonly used git commands which I apparently forget easily
- `IITD_proxy.md` for proxy login into IITD intranet on ubuntu
- `HPC_IITD_Workflow` consolidated step by step guide to use HPC at IITD. (In case, my future self forgets)
- `OD.md` to setup Tensorflow object detection API on ubuntu
- `pbsbatch.sh` sample script to submit to PBS of IITD HPC
