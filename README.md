# Trial
This repo is has some scribbles for common tasks I need. (and adventurous hitchhikers)
- `proxy.sh` for proxy login into IITD intranet (to run in background)
- `GitTutorial.md` some commonly used git commands which I apparently forget easily
- `HPC_IITD_Workflow` consolidated step by step guide to use HPC at IITD. (In case, my future self forgets)
