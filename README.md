This repo is has some scribbles for common tasks I need. (Adventurous hitchhikers, use discretion)
- `git.md` some commonly used git commands which I apparently forget easily
- `proxy_iitd.md` for proxy login into IITD intranet on ubuntu
- `hpc_iitd.md` consolidated step by step guide to use HPC at IITD. (In case, my future self forgets)
- `OD.md` to setup Tensorflow object detection API
- `caffe.md` to setup caffe (and its forks) w/o root permission
- `conda.md` conda virtual environment
- `networkServer.md` working with network server
